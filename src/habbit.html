                    UC Berkeley's iOS DeCal is a student-led class offered to those who want to learn how to use Swift and make iPhone apps. The final project is to create an iOS app from scratch. My project partner, <a id="hi-orange" href="http://irishou.me" target="_blank">Iris Hou,</a> and I wanted to make an app that would improve the efficiency of people's everyday lives.

                    Often times, people set goals for themselves—casual or ambitious—that can be attained through habitual efforts. However, being motivated to follow a consistent routine can be difficult. Also, once the routine is broken, it can be hard to get back in rhythm.

                <p className="writeup">
                    The idea behind Habbit was heavily influenced by a popular bullet journaling element, a tracker, used to help keep track of daily habits and tasks.

                    Carrying around a bullet journal can be troublesome and could result in damaging the journal over time. On the other hand, having a mobile app as a tracker is much more convenient. People bring their phones everywhere, and the tracker would be beneficial to those without bullet journals.

                    We noted that the words "habit" and "rabbit" looked and sounded familiar, so we created a bunny rabbit logo for our app. We originally named the app "Rabit", but eventually changed it to "Habbit". We then decided on a color scheme with green (resembling carrot leaves), white (for the rabbit), and orange (for the carrot itself). We would later decide to only use the white and orange colors for the app.

                    For the app's workflow, we wanted the initial page to display all of the user's current habbits, making it easy for users to view and select habbits they have performed. From there, users could either add and delete habbits, or view another tracker page that displays a grid of habbits performed in the past.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    We decided to use <a id="hi-orange" href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank"><b>Firebase</b></a> as our backend. The backend database would comprise of each user having a user ID, and each user ID having multiple children representing the habbits that the user has created. Every habbit would have information regarding when it was performed in the past and if it was performed today. <br/>

                    Creating Habbit was a challenging yet rewarding experience, especially for our first time making a mobile app. We spent a large amount of time deciding the entire structure before even coding anything since we did not want to waste any time backtracking. It also took some time to learn how certain APIs worked and if they would even contribute to our app.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Through the making of Habbit, we gained a more thorough understanding of how a design concept translates into an actual product. I also gained a greater appreciation for backend as I worked closely with Firebase throughout the project.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Overall, we learned a lot and I am motivated to pursue similar projects in the near future.
